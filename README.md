# Intro Course Project App of Ali Taha Din√ßer for the iPraktikum

To pass the intro course, you need to create your own unique iOS app (based on SwiftUI).

There are no requirements regarding the functions of your app, so you can get creative.
However, we provide you with Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) that your app needs to fulfill.

After each day of learning new Swift and SwiftUI concepts, these NFRs may change, or new NFRs get added.

## Submission procedure

You get a **personal repository** on Gitlab to work on your app.

Once you implemented a new feature into your app, you need to create a Merge Request (MR - Sometimes we will also reference these as "Pull Requests"(PR)) to merge your changes from the feature branch into your main branch.

Your tutor will review your changes and either request changes or approves the MR.

If your MR got approved, you also need to merge it!

### Deadline: **15.10.2024 23:59**

Until the deadline all of your PRs **need to be merged** and your final app **needs to fulfill** all of the requested NFRs!

## Problem Statement (max. 500 words)

Every platform has its own bookmarking system but has limited capabilities. For example, X (formerly Twitter) requires users to have premium membership in order to do categorization, and Instagram only let users to save the posts without labeling or giving a unique identification for them. People struggle to find the saved posts or links  form the internet later on everyday in their life. In order to solve this Yaba (Yet Another Bookmark App) is here, where users can save any link, post or tweet by labeling and/or tagging them, and then, search them easily.

## Requirements

### Functional

- Users can save any type of link by providing a label to it.
- Users can create their own folders for easier categorization.
- Users can save links to folder, in order to easily categorize them.
- Users can search their bookmarks by their label or description.

### Nonfunctional

- Users should see the unfurled version of their saved content. 
- Unfurling the link should be lazily in order to preserve data usage.
- All bookmarks should be saved on device locally.

## Analysis

TODO: Include an analysis object model. You can use [draw.io](https://draw.io) or [apollon](https://apollon.ase.cit.tum.de) to create it. Please add all models as an Image - not as a link!

## System Design

TODO: Include a system design overview describing your application.

## Product Backlog

TODO: Add a product backlog and don't forget to update it with each MR.
